//dynamic weakly typed programming language compiled at runtime,interpreted
created to make webpages dynamic
totally independant from java
synchronous and single threaded 

javascript engine builtin into the browser
code gets compiled to machine code 
operates on one single thread


//dynamic -->code evalvated and executed at runtime
also can be changed

//weaklytyped --> data types are assumed automatically 
no need to declare
data types are not set
manipulate the HTML and CSS codes
it can interact with operates

Node.js 
used to build backends 
can access the local file system and interact with the operating system


client side(Browser) --> allows interaction with webpages and browser API
server side(NodeJS) --> incoming http requests


//javascript Values
--> fixed Values   literals
--> variable values  variables

var,let,const are used to declare variables
also variables are declared automatically

let --> cannot be redeclared ,declared before use

   EXECUTION CONTEXT
variable environment
memory -->key:value and functions
code --> threadus running 

//call stack
bottom of stack is global exceution context 
exceution context will be pushed
once exceution finished then it will be poped away and control goes to GEC
when new function invoked new exceution context created
after whole program completed whole call stack gets deleted
maintains the order of excecution of exceution contexts


//other names of call stack
1. excecution context stack
2. program stack
3. control stack
4. runtime stack
5. machine stack

//hoisting means calling a function before it gets declared 

//undefined vs not defined
undefined --> means the value is not allocated to the memory by compiler
not defined --> means the variable hasn't been declared and defined inside the program

//lexical environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of parent memory
lexical is inorder or inheirarchy

//temporal dead zone
 temporal dead zone is the area where the let and const values are unable to access.
 tdz starts when the code exceution enters and ends when the let and const get declared
//let and const declarations are hoisted

1. let and const are hoisted but its memory is allocated at other place than window which
 cannot be accessed before initialisation.

2. Temporal Dead Zone exists until variable is declared and assigned a value.

3. window.variable OR this.variable will not give value of variable defined using let or const.

4. We cannot redeclare the same variable with let/const(even with using var the second time).

5. const variable declaration and initialisation must be done on the same line.

6. There are three types of error: [1] referenceError {given where variable does not
 have memory allocation} [2] typeError {given when we change type that is not supposed 
 to be changed} [3] syntaxError {when proper syntax(way of writing a statement) is not used}.

7. Use const wherever possible followed by let, Use var as little as possible(only if you have
 to). It helps avoid error.

8. Initialising variables at the top is good idea, helps shrinks TDZ to zero.


//if syntaxError occours then no lines gets executed when let redeclared 
typeError occours when const gets redeclared 
referenceError --> when a javascript engine finds out a  variable inside and you can't access it 
{ at temporal dead zone } 
also when we access a not defined variable referenceError


usage preference

** const
**let 
**var


//block scope  **let and const are block scoped**
bloc --> combining multiple js statements into a block
multiple statements inside a block {} are treated as single statement

//shadowing
if we have same name ouside the block inside variable shadows the outside variable
it should be same variable

//illegal shadowing
if different variable is shadows another variable it is illegal shadowing

//lexical scope
a block inside another block

//closures
it is a function bind to its parent in a lexical environment
function along with lexical scope forms a closure

uses of closures
 module design pattern
 currying
 functions like once
 memoize
 setTimeout
 iterators

//setTimeout
will delay for given seconds

//anonymous functions --> without name
//firstclass funtions --> 

//function statement

a();
b();
function a(){
  console.log("a");
}

//function expression also acts as a variable
var b=function(){
  console.log("b called);
}
diff bw fun exp and fun statement is function statement can be called before it defined (hoisting)

//function declaration
is same as function statement


//anonymous function
without name dont have an identity


 When we creating a function  & put some variables in this ( ) that is our Parameters.
For Ex - function ab( param1, param2 ){
  console.log("");
 }
& When we call this function & pass a variable in this ( ) that is our Arguments
For Ex - ab( 4, 5 );


//The Ability of use function as value,-->first class functions
*     Can be passed as an Argument,
*     Can be executed inside a closured function &
*     Can be taken as return form.


// functions are first class citizens or first class functions

//garbage collections and remove event listners

//event loop and callback queue
//fetch request api 
//micro tasks queue
just like callback queue




//map,filter,reduce
filter --> returns the elements of an array that meet the conditions specified in a callback functions
map --> takes a value and change the value


//currying
apply to a function to generate a new function
is a higher order function 
helps to avoid passing of same variable again and again


this transforms a funtion with multiple argument into a nested series of function each taking a single 
argument


//array
push pop 
shift unshift

//map
The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one 
of the elements of the first array.

//filter
The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If 
this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false,
 the element does not get pushed to the output array.

//reduce
The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a
 reducer function on each element of the array.
